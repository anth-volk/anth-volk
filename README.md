<h2>About Me</h2>

I'm a junior full-stack developer and ethical technologist with a passion for building tech solutions to real-world problems. I have a passion for contributing to software at all points across the software development lifecycle, from ideation to implementation. I'm informed by my past experience working directly with governments and civil society leaders to support governmental reform in areas as diverse as infrastructure, rule of law, and electoral systems.

<h2>Personal Projects</h2>

**STEREO 8s** ([Netlify live link](https://tinyurl.com/bdfdpmsf), [GitHub](https://tinyurl.com/bdvm5f6a))  
_Please note that this app's back end service scales down when inactive, and may be slow when first visited_  
- Full-stack CRUD web application with RESTful API using Node/Express, SQL, and React
- Application consumes the Spotify API and connects with the Spotify SDK to allow users to create virtual 8-track "cartridges"
- Employs custom authentication flow built around short-term JWTs and token refreshing to diminish XSS attack risks
- Provides two separate sets of authentication routes and endpoints, one of which integrates Spotify's authentication system
- Utilizes advanced React concepts, including advanced hooks (e.g., useCallback), React Router, and the Context API

**Egaki** ([GitHub](https://github.com/anth-volk/egaki))  
_Currently under development_
- Custom programming language, written in Python, that interprets to Python at runtime

**TravelSpark** ([GitHub](https://tinyurl.com/2bfty5kj))  
_Development paused_
- Full-stack web application written in Node/Express, SQL, and React that utilizes ChatGPT via the Chat API to enable the creation of sentiment-driven travel itineraries
- Utilizes JavaScript ES6+ class structures to demonstrate object-oriented best practices

**Gomi Frontend Framework** ([GitHub](https://github.com/anth-volk/gomi-frontend-framework))  
_Currently under development_  
- Vanilla JavaScript front-end framework modelled upon React, but intended to allow for rapid scaling of Android apps using Google's standard Material UI design language
- Provides custom JSX transpilation that allows for custom framework-defined elements; at the moment, this includes custom CSS grid and flexbox implementations

**25+5 Clock** ([CodeSandbox](https://f2ywg4.csb.app/))
- Simple React implementation of a 25+5 or "pomodoro" timeboxing clock, aimed at improving work efficiency
- Employs more advanced features of React, such as custom hooks

**macOS Calculator Clone** ([CodeSandbox](https://8miwnq.csb.app/))
- Pixel-perfect React clone of the macOS system calculator application
- Includes logic to mimic particular quirks of macOS calculator application, such as input number shortening
